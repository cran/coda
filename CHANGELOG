0.11-3
- Fixed documentation on subsetting methods for mcmc and mcmc.list objects

0.11-2
- The codamenu function has been modified so that it no longer works with
  coda.dat and work.dat in the global environment, solving global binding
  issues.
- The sample size test at the beginning of codamenu has been corrected
  for the case of multiple chains.
  Thanks to Luwis Diya and Pablo G Goicoechea for these bug reports
- Syntax errors fixed in help pages.
- Description of Gelman and Rubin diagnostic corrected

0.11-1
- Added changes from Dawn Woodward for S-PLUS.
- Fixed global binding problems 

0.10-7
- Documentation clarification for bugs2jags()
- Made linearity test in codamenu less stringent.
  Thanks to Bengt Sennblad.
- Fixed rejectionRate() for single-variable chains.
  Thanks to Rob Scharpf.

0.10-6
- Fixed HPDinterval() for univariate chains
  Thanks to David LeBlond
- Fixed optional parameters in as.data.frame method for mcmc objects

0.10-5
- Registered default method for as.mcmc in NAMESPACE
  Thanks to Christian Grose

0.10-4
- fixed eternal loop in codamenu() when saving plot as PostScript.
  Thanks to Bengt Sennblad.

0.12-3
- added 'data' in lattice generics for compatibility

0.10-2
- Import generics from lattice
- In plotting functions, "ask" now defaults to dev.interactive(),
  and not the default value in par(), as introduced in 0.9-2

0.10-1

- Added "mcmc" and "mcmc.list" methods for several lattice functions
  (xyplot, qqmath, densityplot and acfplot (with generic here as
  well)).  There's a levelplot method too, which is currently
  experimental.  These are Trellis analogs of existing coda functions,
  and may in future replace them.


0.9-5

- Fixed bug in summary.mcmc (safespec0 misspelled) which affected
  univariate chains.

0.9-4

- Fixed documentation errors.

0.9-3

- Added date stamp check in read.openbugs to ensure files were created
  at the same time.

0.9-2
- [RGA] Added an autoburnin flag (default) true to gelman.diag to suppress 
  automatic windowing for burn in (so I can do it manually).
- [RGA] Fixed a problem where summary.mcmc.list would not give correct
  pooled standard errors.
- [RGA] Fixed propagation of standard par and titles to plot.mcmc and
  plot.mcmc.list.  Also fixed so that ask will default to value in
  par(). 
- [RGA] Fixed a problem where autocorr would apply thinning twice to
  mcmc.list objects.
- [RGA] Changed effectiveSize for mcmc.list to sum across all chains.
  Original behavior can be recovered by using lapply(x,effectiveSize)
- [RGA] Added autocorr.diag function.
- [RGA] Patched summary.mcmc and summary.mcmc.list so it would give
  standard error of NA when spectrum0 blows ups.
- [RGA] Added a rejectionRate method.
- [RGA] Added a batch Standard Error Function

0.9-1 
- spectrum0 function now has default max.length argument of 200.
  This means that the output will be batched to a length between
  100 and 200 before fitting the glm to the spectrogram. This
  should improve robustness for chains with high autocorrelation,
  or markedly non-gaussian distributions.
- The read.bugs() function has been removed; read.coda() has been
  modified to allow specification of both output and index files;
  read.bugs.interactive() has been modified in the same way;
  read.openbugs() is a new wrapper function around read.coda() for
  OpenBUGS output.

0.8-3
- Fixed documentation errors in coda.menu.Rd and linepost.Rd

0.8-2
- Added generic function thin to list of exported functions

0.8-1
Continuing problems with namespace:
- Addition of namespace requires new version number for coda,
  as saved workspaces are not backwards compatible.
- Ensured that mcmc attributes are not assumed for objects returned by
  as.matrix.mcmc, as this now no longer returns an mcmc object.
  This occurred in, for example, effectiveSize (which returned NA)
  and gelman.diag (which dropped variable names).
- Changed "[.mcmc.list" and "[.mcmc" so that they return an 
  mcmc.list/mcmc object respectively when subsetting columns.
  plot.mcmc() and plot.mcmc.list() now work again when there is
  only one variable.
- Imported the required time series generics from package stats.
  Failure to do this may result in a saved workspace that cannot be reloaded.
Other problems
- Removed S compatibility (statements conditional on is.R and wrapper 
  function coda.global.assign). Note that S compatibility never worked
  at all, and I now have no intention of supporting it.
- Fixed (old) bug in "[.mcmc" which made column subsets of mcmc objects
  return invisibly.
- Changed the plotting functions so it is no longer necessary to press
  return to see the first page of plots.
  
0.7-3 (changes done by Andrew Martin <admartin@wustl.edu>)
- Added NAMESPACE
- export only functions that I think should have been exported (based on 
  the documentation and common sense).
- Registered all S3 methods.
- Fixed documentation for non-exported functions.
- Patched the "mcmc" function to deal with really big thinning intervals. 
- Patched the "as.matrix.mcmc" function so it really returns matrices.
- Fixed plot method, by having plot.mcmc pass an mcmc object
  rather than a matrix, and by fixing the [.mcmc.list method so it 
  returns an mcmc.list not a matrix.
- Fixed "varnames<-" which was broken when the as.matrix method was 
  fixed.
- Fixed documentation mcmc.convert.Rd such that the usage is consistent 
  with S3 class definition (this fixed an error thrown in the QC tools).

0.7-2
- The spectrum0() function now returns zero when it is given a constant
  vector. summary.mcmc() (which calls spectrum0) now works correctly.

0.7
- Modified to run on R 1.9.0 with new organization of base library

0.6-2
- Fixed documentation bug in raftery.diag

0.6-1
- spectrum0.ar no longer crashes when the chain is a linear function
  of the iteration number
- codamenu automatically drops variables that are linear functions
  of the iteration number
- read.bugs renamed to read.coda. read.bugs exists as an alias.
- initial support for JAGS: bugs2jags function converts WinBUGS
  data to R dump format used by JAGS.
- added cumuplot function (not yet in codamenu system)

0.5-14
- Fixed reporting of sample size in densplot(), for variables that are
  in the range [0,1] or [0,Inf). Thanks to Roy Levy.

0.5-13
- mcmc() now works with data frames (provided that they contain only
  numeric values).

0.5-12
- Documentation errors in coda.options.Rd and nchain.Rd fixed.
  Thanks to Kurt Hornik.

0.5-11
- Fixed bug in mcmc() function that causes problems in Geweke diagnostic
- Fixed geweke.plot so that it works with samples running from iteration
  N to 2N.  These were previously mis-diagnosed as being too short.
  Thanks to Vasco Leemans for finding both bugs.
- In autocorr.plot, the `ask' argument was not used. Thanks to
  Dennis A Wolf.

0.5-10
- Eliminated use of "=" for assignment operator.  This is a syntax error 
  for R < 1.4.0

- Fixed bug in gelman.transform which did not work for univariate chains
  (Thanks to Mark A. Beaumont)
- Fixed confidence limits in geweke.plot
  (Thanks to Mark A. Beaumont)
- Allow user to set ylim in densplot (Thanks to Niels Peter Baadsgaard)

0.5-1

- Replaced time series functions with functions from "ts" library
  (R-base >= 0.65.0)
- Removed calls to Version() (deprecated). Use is.R() instead.
- Added new function read.yesno
- Source files maintained using ESS
- Allowed restart() in codamenu.options.plot.kernel
- Simplified print.coda.options
- Removed "onepage" option in coda.options() (Subsumed in user.layout)
- Removed "mrows" and "mcols" options in coda.options (use par instead)

Changes to Geweke's diagnostic
- Uses new function spectrum0() to estimate spectral density at zero
- Gelman-Rubin-Brooks plot never discards more than half the chain
  to preserve necessary asymptotic conditions.

Changes to Gelman and Rubin's diagnostic
- Multivariate psrf added.
- Documentation for Gelman-Rubin-Brooks plot update to give
  clearer motivation.

Changes to Heidelberger and Welch's diagnostic
- Simplified formula for Cramer-von Mises statistic
- Using new function spectrum0() to estimate spectral density at zero

- p-value is printed in output, using new function pcramer().
- Prints starting iteration of truncated chain instead of number
  of iterations to discard.

0.4-7

Fixed bug in read.bugs.interactive() leading to failure when
user enters both ".ind" and ".out" names (Thanks to John Logsdon).

0.4-6

Archive 0.4-5 was incorrectly compressed with "compress" instead
of "gzip". Corrected by Friedrich Leisch.

0.4-5

- densplot failed with show.obs=TRUE when scale was "positive" or
  "proportion".
- as.matrix.mcmc failed to preserve start, end and thin.
- codamenu did not tidy up on exit.

0.4-4

Started S3 compatibility
Fixed bug which caused options menus to crash
Fixed legend bug in gelman.plot
Confirmed that these bugs are fixed:
* densplot "missing" and "scale" bugs (Thanks to Greg Warnes)
* autocorr "improper time series parameters" bug ("acf"
  function rewritten by Paul Gilbert)
* integer overflow bug in raftery.diag (Thanks to Morten
  Frydenberg)
* read.bugs.interactive will search for the files it needs
  and print their names.
codamenu now assigns default variable and chain names to
data when these are NULL.

0.4-3

Fixed help page errors pointed out by Brian Ripley.
Fixed coda.credits

0.4-2

Whoops. 0.4-1 was a mistake.

   function introduced to deal with old mcmc objects.
plot functions changed to use the "ask" parameter instead of
  "pause" functions.
spec.pgram now handles matrix time-series.

fixed bug in mcmc which allowed non-integer thinning intervals
Fixed manual pages with bad use of "alias" command.

0.3-4

Fixed bug in "tspar<-" which breaks much of the code in R-0.62

0.3-3

Package was in obsolete format. Corrected by Fritz.

** Pre-release changes for R version

Created class "mcmc" with associated constructor and extractor
functions as well as plot, print and summary methods.

Modified diagnostics so they all work on objects of class "mcmc"
and can be called directly by the user. All diagnostics return
objects with associated print methods. Renamed some functions
and arguments for ease of use.

Changed the menu driven interface - now called by the function
"codamenu" - to avoid recursive calling of menu functions.

Put frequently used code inside utility functions.

Got rid of functions written by Mathsoft

Wrote drop-in replacements for some time series functions which
are found in S-PLUS but not R.

The logfile facility has been removed. Sorry.

Changed license terms to GPL.
